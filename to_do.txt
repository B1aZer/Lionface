[2/12/13 6:40:22 AM] Nick: Password reset on the production server is getting the 500 error.

[2/12/13 6:44:45 AM] Nick: People (and me) are also getting the Unable to retrieve data error a lot.

[2/11/13 9:45:37 PM] Nick: would making it shorter put a huge load on the server?

[2/11/13 9:49:25 PM] Nick: And would it be a quick fix to make http://youtu.be/OOpkr8uNWpk style links embed? People keep using them, to their disappointment.

Can you add the ability to change Page usernames to the django admin... someone signed up with the wrong username and I can't adjust it for them.

Also, on Chat, if my message is long and it expands the textarea to more than 1 row, can you reset it to 1 row when I press enter, instead of when I begin typing the next message.

 added ping.ogg to the static directoy, and I added the sound img to the chat tab, however the display is currently "none". the soundOFF.png and soundON.png are both in static/images.

â€¢ The scrolling issue returned: if I open the popup div when I post, before reload, and close it, scroll is disabled for the page.
