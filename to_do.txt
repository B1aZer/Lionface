[2/11/13 9:49:25 PM] Nick: And would it be a quick fix to make http://youtu.be/OOpkr8uNWpk style links embed? People keep using them, to their disappointment.

• The scrolling issue returned: if I open the popup div when I post, before reload, and close it, scroll is disabled for the page.

• If it's quick, I'd really like to add "Just Me" option to /my/ profile postbox, so then I can keep a private diary (the love, comment, share, settings, privacy and follow links should be hidden, only showing the delete option and the timestamp). I also want to add "Just [Friend's FirstName]" to friend's postbox, so that just me, and just that single friend, can see the post (sublinks should be available as normal, except for share (be sure to gray out share in post settings).

redis on dev is taking too much CPU # or no ?

#for page posts we take PagePost objects not Newsfeed
#these posts are adding to feed but not deleting from it

###later###
deleting sharing origin wont delete children
wrong privacy on deleted (newsfeed)
notifiaction flashing is wrong on page load
###
users case insensative ?
prevent new posts (not right ly)
notf nullify (wrong on messages)
###
friends did not see own posts after unfrending.
###temp
visiblity for mess(?) is wrong for user = self


###USEFUL###
from pages.models import Pages
for page in Pages.objects.all():
    page.user.set_option('pages_loves__%s' % page.id,True)
